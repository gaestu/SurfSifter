# SurfSifter — Sample URL List (Demo)
#
# This file demonstrates the URL matching format used by SurfSifter.
# Each non-empty, non-comment line is treated as a substring match pattern
# against extracted URLs. Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# To create your own list:
#   1. Copy this file as a template
#   2. Replace entries below with your target domains/patterns
#   3. Place the file in ~/.config/surfsifter/reference_lists/urllists/
#   4. Reload reference lists in SurfSifter Preferences
#
# Matching is case-insensitive. Both full domains and partial patterns work.

# --- Example entries (using RFC 2606 reserved domains) ---
