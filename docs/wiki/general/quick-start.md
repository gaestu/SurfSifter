# Quick Start

Use this checklist to get a case running end-to-end.

1. **Create a case**
   - File menu -> **Open/Create Case** -> choose an empty directory
2. **Add evidence**
   - Evidence tab -> **Add E01 image** (segments auto-detected)
3. **Run extractors**
   - Extraction tab -> select desired extractors -> **Start**
4. **Review results**
   - Browse tabs such as **URLs**, **Images**, **Browser Inventory**, **Timeline**
5. **Tag and report**
   - Tag findings -> generate a **PDF report**

## Tips
- Extraction is offline and read-only by design.
- Use the **Tools** tab to verify optional external tools are detected.
- If you only need a subset of artifacts, run a smaller extractor set to speed up triage.
