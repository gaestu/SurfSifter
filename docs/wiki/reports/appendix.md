# Appendix

Appendix items are data-only modules that appear after the main report sections. Use them for long lists, supporting evidence, or full data exports.

## How it works
- Appendix items are ordered separately from main sections.
- Each item has its own filters and an optional custom title.
- Appendix content is rendered under an "Appendix" heading in the final report.

## Available appendix modules
- [[reports/appendix/url-list|URL List]]
- [[reports/appendix/file-list|File List]]
- [[reports/appendix/image-list|Image List]]
- [[reports/appendix/extracted-analyzed-data|Extracted and Analyzed Data]]
